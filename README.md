# BFS-using-Lists

C programming language code for BFS using Adjacency List.

The algorithm uses an Adjacency List.

The Graph data structure used is undirected and not weighted.

The Graph looks like the following:

            1--------2
            |        |
            |        |
            |        |              
            4--------3
             \      /
              \    /
               \  /
                 5
               /   \
              /      \
             6        7
             
Here 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7 are the nodes and the rest are the edges.
